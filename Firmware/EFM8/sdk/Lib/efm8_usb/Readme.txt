Release Information:
-------------------

Version 1.0.0
    - Initial release.

Version 1.0.1
    - Fixed bug in logic of remote wakeup feature where the device would 
      attempt to wake the host before enabling its USB transceiver.
    - Fixed bug where the device would stall the Data Phase instead of the 
      Setup Phase when sending a procedural stall on Endpoint 0.
    - Fixed bug where a bus-powered device would look at VBUS after a USB Reset
      to determine if it should enter the Default or Attached State. VBUS is 
      always present on a bus-powered device, so it should automatically enter 
      the Default State.
    - Removed code that generated a compiler warning when
      USB_PWRSAVE_MODE_FASTWAKE was enabled.
    - Improved documentation of USB_PWRSAVE_MODE_FASTWAKE feature.

Version 1.0.2
    - Added ability to detect short OUT packet in Isochronous mode and
      stuff the buffer with zeroes to keep isochronous stream in sync.

Version 1.0.3
    - Added support for EFM8UB3 and EFM8UB4 devices.
