 * @brief Power mode driver for the EFM8UB2.
 *
 * # Introduction #
 *
 * This module provides an API for entering each of the low power modes of 
 * the EFM8UB2. The API reconfigures the system as required to enter each  
 * specific mode, then restores the system configuration upon returning 
 * from that mode. Before calling this API, the application will need to 
 * make additional system adjustments such as disabling unneeded peripherals 
 * or reconfiguring port pins in order to achieve the lowest power for a 
 * given mode. Also, the application will need to properly configure any 
 * peripheral or subsystem that is used to wake the device from a low power 
 * mode.
 *
 * ## Memory Usage ##
 *
 * The following table shows the approximate amount of memory used by this
 * module with various features enabled.  Typically, only a portion of the 
 * module's API is used, so actual memory usage is expected to be less.
 *
 * |Config     |Macro                        | CODE | XDATA | IDATA | DATA |
 * |-----------|-----------------------------|------|-------|-------|------|
 * |Default    |                             |   42 |     0 |     0 |    0 |
 * |Stop       |EFM8PDL_PWR_USE_STOP         |  +15 |     0 |     0 |    0 | 
 * |Auto Page  |EFM8PDL_PWR_AUTO_PAGE        |   +8 |     0 |     0 |    0 | 
 *
 * ## Supported Power Modes ##
 *
 * This module provides functions for entering each of the modes listed below. 
 * To reduce memory footprint, build options are provided to include each API 
 * individually. The supported modes are listed from highest to lowest power.
 *
 *  - **Idle**: The CPU core is halted; peripherals are fully operational; 
 *    the core waits for any interrupt to continue.
 *  - **Stop**: All clocks are stopped; memory is retained; the device waits 
 *    for any reset source to restart.
 *  - **Suspend**: The high-frequency internal clocks are halted; select 
 *    peripherals remain active; the system waits for a wake event to continue.
 * 	- **Shutdown**: The CPU is halted; internal circuitry is powered down,
 *	  no RAM nor registers are retained; external I/O retain configured state, 
 *	  system waits for POR or pin reset to wake up the device.

/**************************************************************************//**
 * @def EFM8PDL_PWR_USE_STOP
 * @brief Controls inclusion of the Power STOP Mode API.
 *
 * If this setting is '1' the API for entering Stop mode is included.
 *
 * @warning Suspend mode provides equal or better power savings with a faster 
 * wake-up time. Stop mode is supported for legacy reasons only. New designs
 * are strongly encouraged to use Suspend mode instead.
 *
 * Default setting is '0' and may be overridden by defining in 'efm8_config.h'.

/**************************************************************************//**
 * @def EFM8PDL_PWR_AUTO_PAGE
 * @brief Provides automatic SFR paging and restoring.
 *
 * If this setting is '1' the power driver will not assume the SFR page and 
 * will explicitly set and restore the SFR page whenever it accesses an SFR. 
 * This adds more code and processing time to the power driver API. If your 
 * code ensures that the SFRPAGE remains at 0 by default whenever calling 
 * this API, then this setting can be turned off which will save code and 
 * improve performance.
 *
 * The default setting is '1' and may be overridden by defining the value
 * in 'efm8_config.h'.

 * Enter power mode IDLE. 
 *
 * Idle is a standard 8051 power mode. The core is halted with all peripherals 
 * clocked and fully operational. All internal registers and memory are retained. 
 * Power consumption is dependent upon the system clock frequency and any active 
 * peripherals.
 * 
 * This function returns when any enabled interrupt is asserted. Also, any reset 
 * will cancel Idle mode and resume execution from the reset vector.

 * ~~~~~
 *
 * @note A watchdog (WDT) time-out will cancel Idle mode by generating a reset.
 *
 * @note To achieve lowest power, this function selects flash one-shot read 
 * timing before entering Idle mode and restores the original value upon return.
 * Note that one-shot flash read timing will be in effect when the resuming 
 * interrupt handler runs. 
 *
 * @warning This API is not re-entrant and must not be called from interrupt
 * context.

 * Enter power mode SUSPEND.
 *
 * Suspend is similar to Stop mode, resumes execution at the next instruction
 * with a very fast wake-up time and the CPU, depending on its source, may or
 * may not be halted. In Suspend mode peripheral clocks are halted; high-
 * frequency internal oscillators are disabled; and all internal registers,
 * memory and ports are retained. If the system clock is sourced by the high-
 * frequency oscillator, the CPU will be halted and execution will resume after
 * a wake-up event. Else if the system is running on a different oscillator,
 * the CPU will not be halted and may continue executing instructions.
 *
 * This function sources the system clock with the high-frequency oscillator,
 * halting the CPU, and returns when USB0 Bus Activity occurs. The application is
 * responsible for configuring the associated peripheral to generate the event.
 *
 * Additionally, Suspend is terminated by any reset source with execution
 * resuming at the reset vector.
 *
 * If USB0 Bus Activity is detected on entry, the function will return immediately.
 *
 * ~~~~~.c
 * // Configure a USB0 Bus Activity event
 *
 * // Enter Suspend mode waiting for USB0 Bus Activity event
 * PWR_enterSuspend();
 * ~~~~~
 *
 * @note Suspend is a power mode designed to meet and support functionality for USB
 * specific low-power suspend mode. Suspend mode on EFM8UB2 is different from other
 * EFM8 devices in that the mode was designed to work in conjunction with USB
 * applications (as well as a stand-alone power mode). For USB development, this
 * function should serve as a reference for the steps to get into suspend mode and
 * to view the corresponding current consumption numbers. To use suspend mode for
 * USB development, refer to the EFM8 USB Library API for more information.
 *
 * @note This routine automatically adjusts the system clock to ensure
 * Suspend mode is entered with the CPU halted. The original system settings are
 * restored on wake-up.
 *
 * @note To provide consistent timing, this function disables and restores the
 * global interrupt enable until after all system settings are restored. For
 * wake-up sources that have interrupts enabled, the ISR will not be serviced
 * until after the original clock settings are restored. This ensures that the
 * ISR runs under the original application settings.

 * in their selected states, but are not provided a clock.
